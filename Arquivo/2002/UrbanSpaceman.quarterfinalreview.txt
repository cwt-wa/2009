Hi, UrbanSpaceman here, just writing to tell you that I beat Bytor
2-1 in what was by FAR the hardest and best game of the tournament.
He beat me in the first round, but I JUST managed to win the incredibly
intense second round, and the third was simply unbelievable, but I
won it with one worm left and hardly any energy.

Peace, USM
