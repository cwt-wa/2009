<p align="left" style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4" color="#FFFFFF" face="SketchHeavy">This was a
try-out, indeed. I now know what should I avoy to do when I start things for
next year's tournament. I should've selected better and more responsable wormers
to play here, although some good and honorable wormers also joined the
tournament.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p align="left" style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4" color="#FFFFFF" face="sketchheavy">Some shit
happened: wormers
that didn't care enough to get the games arranged on schedule, wormers that just
quit,
wormers that have suddenly stopped replying any e-mails, and even a fuckin' cow
that tried to lie about a game score and not less important he also disrespected
some other wormer(s) in the tournament.</font>

<p align="left" style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4" color="#FFFFFF" face="sketchheavy">Anyway
I believe the playoff stage was an awesome stage as everyone managed to play
their games and had fair play and honor.</font>

<p align="left" style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4" color="#FFFFFF" face="sketchheavy">One
thing that I would like to focus on is the oportunity we have to know other
people from several places on Earth, people from places so so much diferent than
the place you live. The clash of cultures and personalities is something
that touches my mind. There were 8 wormers from USA (although two of them were
born in Germany), 8 from UK (one lives in Holland), 4 from Portugal, 2 from
Australia, 2 from Sweden, 1 from Poland, 1 from Holland, 1 from France, 1 from
Spain, 1 from Italy, 1 from Canada, 1 from Finland and 1 more wormer from
Brazil.</font>

<p align="left" style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4" color="#FFFFFF" face="SketchHeavy">The following
list tells you what do I think about every wormer that entered 2002 CWT (listed in alphabetical
order):</font></p>

      The swedish cow. Although I don't like wormers that cow-quit the

      don't admit is the lack of fair-play. I could tell you guys the whole

      the text carachters wasted on them.</font>

      the quarter-finals... When someone asked me about the favourites for
