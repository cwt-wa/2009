    <DIV class="data">Worms for me :
1.	Is a sport. A lot of exciting games, challenges, hard wins and dramatic losses.
2.	Is a brain trainer. We can train our brain here, and a key to be the winner is to think faster and wider then your opponent. All depends on your brain and skills, that’s nice.
3.	Is a place where I got a lot of good friends. In spite of I can’t meet them on the street of my city these people changed my life, they taught me a lot. I have a lot of situations in worms which I met later in real life and I knew what to do. So I can call worms community as a school of relationship. I met a lot of interesting people here with different characters from different countries. I can say our community is a group of intelligent and clever people, it is a honor to be a part of this company.

About my playing style and spirit aspects.
I prefer to play aggressive style, it is nice to kill opponent fast if it is possible (SD luck is not for me  ). I don’t like “lightsiding/darksiding” talking – there is an optimal strategy in every game, especially in worms. So if we talk about pro playing we talk about optimal strategy.
Some of my principles:
1.	Respect your opponent
2.	If you came to play a match, you came to win
3.	Everything is in your hands, noone can stop you if you know what to do and you can get this knowledge
4.	You always have a chance, so play to the end
5.	If you played dirty, you lost the game (result doesn’t count)
6.	You are the best - if you are really the best, a win doesn’t make you the best - it makes you a winner </DIV>
